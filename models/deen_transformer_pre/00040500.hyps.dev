the Congressed Keith Ellison and John Lewis have a legislative proposed a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions .
`` Ellison , &apos;&apos; also says the central classes , &apos;&apos; said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota , a Democrat of Minnesota and Caucus in Congress .
I therefore proud , together with the Ombudsman Lewis the employee law .
this black of law are the same legal opportunities in discrimination , because of the organisation of trade unions , such as other forms of discrimination and stopped forces .
the completion of the national labour legal legal legal legal legislation to create a possibility for discrimination of work to organisation of a trade unions , in order to create justice , in order to create justice - is a sensive and necessary initiative .
but there is no radical initiative - not after American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the further sponsors of their legislative proposals , the connection to a very American idea .
despite the return that the trade unions in the past years - in Wisconsation , Michigan and other states , Americans and other countries in all the world - Americans in all the world - in all the world - in all the world .
there have been a time to remind of millions of Americans , as this country of democracy , freedom , freedom , press freedom of movement and the United States .
as the United States after the Second World War , Japan &apos; s , the General Douglas Mac Arthur and his state of the country to adopt a constitution to adopt a constitution that militarisation would be replaced by democracy .
in full awareness that workers and their trade unions in creating a new japan role in creating a new japan role , use a language which explicitly announced that ` the rights of workers &apos; rights &apos; .
as the United States after the Second World War in Germany , urban , urgent General Dwight David Eisenhower and his state the Deutsche , which would ensure that the fabrics would be replaced by a strong democracy .

agreements which this right or restricted to this right or restricted it , are null and nothing ; it is unacceptable .
as a whole , Lady Eleanor Roosevelt the Presidency of the International Human Rights Commission &apos;s Human Rights Commission &apos;s Human Rights in 1948 .
Americans , Americans , the fundamental representation of human rights are .
as a result of the other countries , such as the civilian and democratic societies , explained Americans that the right to focus on trade - and that this trade will then be able to take part in collective negotiations as equal partners with businesses and governments .
after these rights in America &apos;s rights , it is indeed , the American ideal once again , the American ideal again , according to the labour population , according to the workforce , and of a free and open society in a free and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.
the history is a great amount of life .
now all , the workers know that the jobs of nation is not limited , but they are aimed .
the limitation of living standards of millions of people have created a market for the industry and the entire nation of the entire standards of production .
those who understand the job , forget this simple truths , but the history .
history , and that we should do so .
the formal recognition of labour rights - and the enlargement of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers - is long-term .
